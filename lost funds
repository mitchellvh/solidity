Hi guys, a while ago I transfered my Metis Funds (worth over 125.000$ right now) to the Metis contract address in state of my Metamask wallet address.
I really hope some experienced people overhere can tell me if we can get these tokens back and will pay 15.000$ for the solution.
From what I have heard it's impossible to get these tokens back but I am just hoping for a miracle. Just let me know if you can help met and I will cover all cost
that is needed to fix this problem.
